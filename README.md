boomshineking: CAN you see the entire root folder of cnn ? 

GitHub Copilot: No, I can't see the entire root folder of the cnn project. I can only access files you share directly or reference in your questions. If you want me to review or modify other files, please upload or specify them.

boomshineking: based on the entire root folder of cnn can you create me a good readme.md file 

Workspace: 

boomshineking: can you give me a proper readme.md file for git hub please 

Workspace: Sure, here's a proposed directory structure for a CNN project app:

# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN

This repository contains a complete pipeline for training, evaluating, and deploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training with MLflow tracking, and a Gradio web app for interactive inference.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare Data

- The CIFAR-10 dataset is expected in `data/raw/cifar10/`.
- Use scripts in `src/data_ingestion/` to download and preprocess data if not already present.

### 3. Train the Model

```bash
python train.py
```
- Trains a CNN on CIFAR-10.
- Tracks experiments and metrics using MLflow.
- Model artifacts are saved in the `mlruns/` directory.

### 4. Launch the Gradio Web App

```bash
python app_gradio.py
```
- Opens a web interface for uploading images and viewing model predictions.

## Key Components

- **Model Training:**  
  See [`train.py`](train.py) for model definition, training loop, and MLflow integration.

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Handled in [`src/data_ingestion/preprocess.py`](src/data_ingestion/preprocess.py).

- **Gradio App:**  
  See [`app_gradio.py`](app_gradio.py) for the interactive demo using the trained model.

- **Experiment Tracking:**  
  MLflow logs parameters, metrics, and models. Launch the MLflow UI with:
  ```bash
  mlflow ui
  ```
